❓ Problem Statement
Many homeowners want to follow Vastu Shastra for positivity and prosperity, but consulting experts is expensive and manual floor planning often leads to errors. There is a lack of accessible, digital tools that provide real-time Vastu validation during the design phase.


💡 The Solution
VastuHome Planner is a web-based application that allows users to plan their home layout while receiving instant feedback based on Vastu algorithms. It analyzes the placement of rooms (Kitchen, Bedroom, Entrance) relative to the 8 cardinal directions, ensuring the home is built for peace and success.


🛠️ Tech Stack
 * Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS (for a sleek, modern architectural UI)
 * Backend: Node.js & Express (to handle Vastu logic and calculations)
 * Algorithm: Custom Logic Engine for Directional Mapping


✨ Key Features
 * Interactive Floor Mapper: Drag and drop rooms into a grid-based layout.
 * Real-time Vastu Score: A dynamic progress bar that updates as you place rooms.
 * Directional Heatmap: Visual indicators (Green/Red) showing if a room is in its "Ideal" or "Forbidden" zone.
 * Remedies Generator: If a room is misplaced, the app suggests scientific Vastu remedies (e.g., specific colors or mirror placements).
